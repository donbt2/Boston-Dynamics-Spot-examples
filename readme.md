# Boston Dynamics Spot – SDK Setup & Basic Control Script

This repository provides:

1. A Python script to interact with Boston Dynamics' Spot robot (`spot_basic_script.py`) that performs a short demo sequence.
2. Step-by-step instructions to set up your development environment using the official Spot SDK

> This guide assumes you have access to a Spot robot and the corresponding credentials

---

## Contents

* `spot_basic_script.py` – Authenticates, powers on Spot, makes it stand, spins, changes height, and powers it off.
* Spot SDK setup instructions – Based on [Boston Dynamics' quickstart guide](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/python/quickstart).

## 1. Spot SDK Environment Setup

 **Note:** Follow the official SDK documentation to install Python dependencies and verify your setup.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

```bash
# Clone the Spot SDK repository
git clone https://github.com/boston-dynamics/spot-sdk.git
cd spot-sdk

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv spotenv
source spotenv/bin/activate

# Install required Python packages
python3 -m pip install bosdyn-client bosdyn-mission
```

To confirm your setup is working, run:

```bash
python3
>>> import bosdyn.client
>>> help(bosdyn.client)
>>> exit()
```

## 2. Set Up Estop (Emergency Stop)

Spot requires an Estop system to be engaged before executing any robot commands.

To set up a basic Estop server without a GUI:

```bash
cd python/examples/estop
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 estop_nogui.py <ROBOT_IP>
```

Replace `<ROBOT_IP>` with your Spot's IP address.

Leave this terminal running while executing control scripts.

---

## 3. Custom Script – `spot_basic_script.py`

### Description

This script connects to Spot, authenticates, powers it on, makes it stand, spins twice, moves up and down, then safely powers off.

### Script Features

* Authenticates with Spot
* Syncs time
* Acquires a lease
* Sets up a simple Estop endpoint
* Powers on Spot
* Commands Spot to:

  * Stand up
  * Spin in place twice
  * Move body up and down
* Powers off and cleans up

### Usage

```bash
python spot_basic_script.py <ROBOT_IP> <USERNAME:PASSWORD>
```

### Example

```bash
python spot_basic_script.py 192.168.80.3 admin:admin123
```

> Ensure you’ve set up the Estop before running this, or the command will fail.

## Notes

* Make sure Spot is in a safe and open environment before running any movement commands.
* Always use a properly configured Estop during testing.
* The SDK and API are subject to Boston Dynamics’ license agreement.
